"""
Phase 10.3 Part-1 — Dynamic Indicator Selection.

Distinct in kind from regime_weight_engine.py's CONTINUOUS per-factor
multiplier table: this module makes a CATEGORICAL relevance call per
regime — which confluence factors are "primary" (most trustworthy in this
regime) vs "low relevance" (still computed and still voting, just
discounted) vs neutral (untouched).

Deliberate design choice: a deselected factor's weight is REDUCED, never
zeroed. Zeroing would (a) be equivalent to permanently disabling an
indicator, which is a Settings-level user decision
(_apply_settings_weight_overrides in webapp/app.py), not something an
automatic regime classifier should do, and (b) risks starving
analyzer.generate_confluence_signal()'s "agreeing_factors >= 3" requirement
of real information — vote counting is based on the factor's vote sign, not
its weight, so a zeroed factor could still count toward "agreeing" while
contributing nothing, which is a worse, more confusing outcome than a mild
discount. "Return Unknown instead of guessing" (Phase 10.3 scope) is
respected the same way: Uncertain/Mixed and Unknown regimes select nothing
and change nothing.

Independently testable: apply_dynamic_indicator_selection() takes a plain
weights dict + a regime_result dict, no other dependency.
