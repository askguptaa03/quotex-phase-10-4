"""
Phase 7.2 — Backtest Engine
============================
A standalone module (deliberately NOT merged into scanner.py, per Phase 7.2's
explicit requirement that the Smart Scanner architecture stay untouched).
Mirrors scanner.py's proven async lifecycle pattern (STOPPED/RUNNING/PAUSED,
pause/resume via asyncio.Event, one instance submitted onto the existing
shared _BG_LOOP — this module never creates its own event loop).

Reuses ONLY existing, unmodified functions:
  - backtest.backtest_factor_accuracy()
  - backtest.compute_dynamic_weights()
  - backtest.backtest_filter_score_report()
No indicator, confluence, or filter-score math is duplicated here. Does not
import or touch analyzer.py, scanner.py, the Quotex API, or WebSocket code.

Analysis only. Never places an order. Never mutates indicator weights on its
own — results (including suggested weights) are kept IN MEMORY ONLY on this
engine instance. Writing them into settings.json is a separate, explicit,
user-triggered action (Settings page / a future route), not performed here.
