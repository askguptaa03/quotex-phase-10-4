"""
Backtest-based dynamic factor weighting for the Quotex Market Analyzer.

Replays each of the 10 confluence factors (bb, rsi_div, stoch, cci, candle,
mean_reversion, exhaustion, round_number, obv, sr) bar-by-bar across
already-fetched historical candles, and measures how often each factor's
vote correctly predicted price direction `lookahead` candles later. Purely
historical/statistical analysis on data already in memory — NEVER places
orders, NEVER calls any network/API function.

# constant had no real effect on behavior — compute_dynamic_weights' 20 was

#
# Bug fix, prerequisite for Phase 9 (found auditing the live pipeline):
# this dict previously had only the original 10 factors at their
# pre-Phase-8.6 value (10.0 each). Since compute_dynamic_weights() below
# builds its ENTIRE output from this dict's keys, wick_rejection/
# liquidity_sweep/false_breakout were never present in its result at
# all — and because generate_confluence_signal() REPLACES (not merges)
# its weights dict when a non-empty dynamic_weights is passed, those 3
# indicators silently received an effective weight of 0 on every real
# request through app.py's live pipeline, despite their votes being
# computed correctly. Confirmed end-to-end with the real functions
# before this fix (see docs/CHANGELOG.md's Phase 9 entry for the
# verification trace). The 10 original factors' *values* also had to
# move from 10.0 to 7.69 here (not just the 3 new keys added) — with 13
# keys now sharing the reserved-weight budget, leaving the old 10.0s in
# place would sum to 123.1 instead of 100 and break
# compute_dynamic_weights()'s "reserved / remaining_budget" math. This
# is a data-only change — no rule in compute_dynamic_weights() below is
# touched, and _factor_votes()/backtest_factor_accuracy() still only
# score the original 10 (extending backtested accuracy scoring itself
# to the 3 new indicators remains the separately-tracked NEXT_PHASE.md
