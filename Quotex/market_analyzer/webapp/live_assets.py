"""
Live Quotex Asset Availability layer (additive, read-only, new file).

Single source of truth for "which OTC assets are currently tradeable on
Quotex right now". Wraps the EXISTING QuotexDataFetcher.get_available_assets()
(market_analyzer/fetch_data.py) -> AsyncQuotexClient.get_available_assets()
(quotex/api_quotex/client.py, untouched) via the project's EXISTING shared
fetcher/session (app.py's _get_shared_fetcher()) — no second Quotex login,
no new WebSocket/connection logic, no changes to client.py or any other
Quotex API internals.

api_quotex/constants.py's static ASSETS dict remains the KNOWN/REFERENCE
universe only (used for backtest/historical work, which does not depend on
live availability) — this module NEVER treats that static list as
"currently available". Availability always comes from a live client call;
if that call fails or the session is unavailable, functions here return
empty/False rather than falling back to the static list or fabricating a
result.

Public interface:
  get_live_assets(fetcher, force_refresh=False)           -> {symbol: info}
  get_live_otc_assets(fetcher, force_refresh=False)        -> {symbol: info}  (open + OTC only)
  is_asset_available(fetcher, asset, force_refresh=False)  -> bool

    Finding B fix — the caller-supplied "assets" override (e.g. an explicit
    request body to /api/scanner/start or /api/validation/run) must not be
    able to bypass live availability. Intersects every OTC-suffixed symbol
    in `requested` against `live_otc_symbols` (the current live snapshot);
    an OTC symbol not currently live-available is dropped, never scanned/
    validated. Non-OTC symbols (e.g. regular "LIVE" market pairs) are
    outside this live-availability system's scope — same OTC-only scope as
    every other function in this module — and pass through unfiltered,
